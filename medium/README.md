What is LightningCash ?
----------------------

Lightning Cash  is a very fast cryptocurrency based on Yespower POW algorithm, including DarkGravityWave ( difficulty changes for every block ) and possible CURRENT block difficulty change over time to protect against high network hash variation and long stale tip. For full details, please visit our website at https://lightningcash.com . Compiled binary releases are available on LightningCash's github.


LightningCash has been launched on March 6th 2019, and is the result of 5 months and a half of research and testing. It is constantly developped, updated and improved.



Lightning Cash  Core is the full node software that makes up the backbone of the LTNC network.

Characteristics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 5 seconds block time ( fastest bitcoin-based cryptocurrency in the world )

- Average transaction time : Confirmed in 30 seconds. ( A Bitcoin's transaction takes 1 hour on average to be confirmed )

- Hash Algorithm : Unique YespowerLTNC POW algorithm, based on YesPoWer  ( CPU only, ASIC and GPU resistant ), with the addition of a uniquely modified Dash's DarkGravityWave v3 algorithm, that retargets difficulty every block, AND progressively lowers the mining difficulty for the CURRENT block if the blockchain stalls for more than 10 minutes. The coin has been attacked many times in the past and this security measure has been tested and is fully working as intended !


- The Hive mining system : A " hodl and profit " mining system accessible to everyone, that works side by side with POW mining, invented by  LitecoinCash's developers !!

- Total Supply : 210 000 000 LTNC

- Difficulty adjusted every block and possibly in CURRENT block if a long network stale tip happens !! This protects LightningCash from high hash variations and " high hash attacks " , that happens frequently for new coins and kills them by making the mining difficulty too high for the " normal " network's hash rate.

- Changed famous NOMP ( node open mining portal ) pool software to include possible CURRENT block difficulty change and send new work to miners if so.

NOMP's node-stratum-pool module adapted code :

- Number of confirmations needed for a transaction : 6, so a transaction is confirmed on average in 30 seconds

- Premine : 2 200 000 coins, 1.047 % of Total Supply

- Block Reward : 5 LTNC - halved every 2 100 000 blocks

- Minimum transaction fee : 0.0001
